<h2>About</h2>
<p>I am the founder of Lary Abel Networks and Multimedia Solutions (LANAMS), based in Landover, Maryland. It is a private organization in the IT industry with the goal of bringing solutions to the public in a comfortable way. I have been in the sector for 4 years working either as an independent contractor, a freelancer, working in the corporate settings or working remotely as a Systems Administrator and a Web Developer. In the past 2 years I have mostly been working solely as a Web contractor serving small and medium organizations. I have built a large website portfolio with customers ranging from across Africa, United Kingdom and in the USA. I take pride in my work and many of my clients always bring back business and referrals. I have been successful as a contractor, not just because of my quality works but also my programming skills, but because I am skilled and dependable web programmer and a Systems Administrator that can be trusted to follow through with my work. I enjoy working directly with clients, rather than having third party project managers involved. Even though I seldom meeting clients in person, I am able to effectively communicate via Email, on social media and on the phone to complete website development projects to their specifications. I have developed websites with .NET platform in the past but my focus now is strictly on HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript and other Web Services cutting-edge technologies in which case most part of my portfolio would be featuring projects developed with these technologies. As a Web Developer, I build complete websites from scratch, Host websites, develop MySQL databases, take on small projects in existing websites, troubleshoot code bugs. My website portfolio only shows samples of projects I have developed over the years so please feel free to contact me to discuss your project.</p>
